#  It is a headache to use BASH or ZSH to create a complex setup pipeline that is portables across OSs. Instead I ended up using Python.
# Note: using python is easier to implement however you can not create a conda env with it, for example when the repo is downloaded and u call setup.py and lets say its job is to create the env and activate it but this will cause an error if setup.py has python modules that are not installed, we first what to create the env than activate it and this way when we use python the modules are already installed.
