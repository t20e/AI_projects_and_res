# AI_public_projects

ðŸ’¡ *A repo that contains all my public AI projects.*

***Dev Note**: Every sub project must have its own .gitignore*



### How To Download A Sub-Project

Unfortunately Github makes cloning a sub-project difficult, the workaround is to use Github's `github.dev` web-based editor.

Steps:
1. Press the `period` key -> which will open this repo in github.dev editor.
2. Right-click on the sub-project you want and hit the download option.
3. Open that project in your IDE and read its `README.md`
