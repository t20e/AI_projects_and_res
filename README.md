# AI_projects_and_res

ðŸ’¡ *A repo that contains all my public AI projects and resources.*

*Dev Note:* Every sub project must have its own .gitignore



### How To Download A Sub-Project

Unfortunately Github makes cloning a sub-project difficult, the workaround is to use Github's `github.dev` web-based editor.

Steps:
1. Press the `period (.)` key -> which will open this repo in github.dev editor.

2. Right-click on the <u>sub-project</u> you want and hit the download option.
    - `Note` github.dev won't let you save it to a folder that contains system files like */downloads* instead **save** it to */downloads/{folder_name}*
3. Cd into that <u>sub-project</u>'s directory in your CLI.
4. Open that <u>sub-project</u> in your IDE and read its `README.md`
